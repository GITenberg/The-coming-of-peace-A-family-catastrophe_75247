<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

</div>

<p>A few words about the author of “Friedensfest,” which
is here translated as “The Coming of Peace,” will possibly
be of interest to readers. Gerhart Hauptmann, who is
still a comparatively young man, is as yet little known
to English readers, and wholly unknown to English play-goers,
except for the performance of this play under the
auspices of the Stage Society on the 10th of June 1900,
which has given occasion for this translation. In German-speaking
countries he is recognised by many as the
greatest modern dramatist with the single exception of
Henrik Ibsen.</p>

<p>He is certainly the only dramatist who, writing under
the inspiration of the great Norwegian poet, can by any
remotest possibility be considered to have advanced a
step beyond his master in dramatic treatment of the
inner social forces of modern life.</p>

<p>It is not my intention here to do more than draw
attention to the place Friedensfest occupies chronologically
among its author’s works, and to point out
its probable source of inspiration. Those who wish
to trace the author’s career up to three years ago—he is
now only thirty-eight—may be recommended to read
“Gerhart Hauptmann, sein Lebensgang und seine Dichtung,”
written just after the publication of “Die Versunkene
Glocke,” by Dr Paul Schlenther, the gifted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
critic, now manager of the Vienna Court Theatre. I
may, perhaps, be allowed to quote the final sentences
of that book to show the high hopes entertained in
Germany of Hauptmann’s future. “At thirty-five years
old,” writes Dr Schlenther, “he is a famous man. He
stands at life’s zenith. Half the Scriptural age lies behind
him. The best years of the strength and ripeness of manhood
lie close ahead of him. We wait for what shall
come.”</p>

<p>“Friedensfest” was played in 1890, when Hauptmann
was twenty-seven, eight years before these lines were
penned. It was preceded by “Vor Sonnenaufgang” in
1889—the first utterance which gave more than local
fame to its author—and was succeeded by “Einsame
Menschen” in 1891. Of his later works “Die Weber” and
“Hannele” have already been translated into English.</p>

<p>In “Friedensfest” and “Einsame Menschen” the
influence of Ibsen can be traced more distinctly than in
any of Hauptmann’s other works. “Friedensfest” recalls
in many respects Ibsen’s “Ghosts,” without any servile
copying on the part of the younger author—who has
presented his characters with a power and originality, a
truth and subtlety peculiarly his own. Moreover he has
not been so relentless as Ibsen. Although the “Family
Catastrophe,” as he calls it, is gloomy enough, in a sense
the play ends more hopefully; the doom has not fallen
on the younger members of the Scholz family, with whose
hereditary qualities the play chiefly deals, and we are
permitted to hope, if we choose, that it may never fall.
Hauptmann’s genius shows itself here of a softer and
less uncompromising mould than Ibsen’s. We feel that
in as far as the play has any tendency, it leans rather<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
towards meliorism than pessimism. Like Ibsen’s later
works, however, it is more objective in treatment than
“Ghosts”—more a “family document” pure and simple,
than a “tendency” drama.</p>

<p>But it is not my business here to tell the story of the
play or to attempt any interpretation. I have merely
helped to render it into English.</p>

<p>In translating, we have tried to give the broken,
elliptical language in which Hauptmann’s characters
express themselves, as faithfully as possible—to keep
the half-finished sentences and interjaculatory outbursts
without losing anything of the meaning of the play.
Here and there, the rude colloquialism of the speakers,
especially of Mrs Scholz and Friebe, have rendered our
task almost impossible. We can only plead that we
have done our best.</p>

<p>The Play takes place on Christmas Eve 188—, in a lonely
country house, near Erkner, in Brandenburg.</p>

</div>

<p class="hanging">A high, roomy, white-washed Hall—hung with old-fashioned
pictures—horns and heads of different animals. A
chandelier of stag’s horns hanging from the middle of the
roof-tree is filled with fresh candles. At the back, in the
middle of the wall, is a porch, which projects into the
hall, with a glass door, through which is seen the heavy
carved oaken door of the house. On the top of the porch
is a stuffed moorcock: right and left above the level of
the porch are windows—frozen and partly dim with snow.</p>

<p class="hanging">To the left is an open arch, built like a gateway—which leads
by the staircase to the upper stories. Two low doors in
the same wall lead—one to the cellar, the other to the
kitchen.</p>

<p class="hanging">Two other doors in the opposite wall both open into one room;
between these stands an old grandfather’s clock, on the
top of which squats a stuffed screech-owl. The furniture
of the room consists of heavy old oak chairs and tables:
parallel to the left wall is a table covered with a white
cloth. Down the stage to the left is a small iron stove,
the flue of which runs along the wall. All the doors are
gaily coloured, the panels filled with old-fashioned paintings
of parrots, etc.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ACT_I">ACT I</h2>

</div>

<p class="hanging">The hall is decorated with green branches. A Christmas tree
is lying on the stone flags. Friebe, sitting on the top of
the cellar steps, is making a socket for it; Mrs Buchner
and Mrs Scholz, standing on either side of the table, are
busy fastening gay coloured wax candles into their holders.
Mrs Buchner is a healthy looking, well nourished, friendly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
faced woman, simple, genuine and very neatly dressed:
wears her hair smooth: her movements are decided and
she is entirely at her ease. Her whole appearance expresses
an unusual cordiality which is thoroughly sincere, even if
at times her manner suggests affectation. Her way of
speaking is fluent and clear, and in moments of excitement
declamatory; an atmosphere of peace and well-being
seems to emanate from her. Mrs Scholz, on the contrary,
is a woman who looks older than she is, showing signs of
premature old age. She is unhealthily fat, with a sallow
skin. Her dress is untidy, her hair grey and unkempt;
she wears spectacles. Mrs Scholz is fidgety in her movements,
restless, has generally a tearful or whining way of
speaking and is evidently in a continual state of excitement.
Whilst Mrs Buchner seems only to live for others,
Mrs Scholz is completely occupied with herself.</p>

<p class="hanging">On the table stand two five-branched candlesticks, fitted with
candles; but neither these nor the candles in the chandelier
are lighted. There is a lamp burning.</p>

and stubble beard are yellowish grey. He is a
jack-of-all-trades. His coat, stiff with a mixture
of plate powder, oil, boot-blacking and dust, was
cut for a man twice his size, so that the sleeves
are tucked up and the skirts overlap considerably.
His brown servant’s apron is no cleaner than his
coat: from under it from time to time he brings
out a snuff-box and takes snuff with intense satisfaction.

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs Scholz.</span></p>

<p class="speech">No indeed! If ever I’d suggested one, my husband would
have never let me hear the end of it. With my dear
parents—Ah! when I remember—what a beautiful
family life that was. Never a Christmas without a
tree! (<i>Imitating her father’s gait and manner.</i>) And
then in the evening when father came from the office
and brought the beau—u—tiful gingerbread with
him (<i>joining thumb and fore-finger as if she held a
piece of the famous cake between them—she puts them
to her mouth</i>). Ah yes—those days are gone. My
husband—he wouldn’t even eat his dinner with us—he
lived upstairs—we down—a perfect hermit. If
one wanted anything from him—good Lord—the
only way was to get hold of Friebe.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Goes out after her.</i></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs Scholz</span> (<i>with resignation</i>).</p>

<p class="speech">All my children are like that!—ah—what a girl!
There’s no holding her! First she wants one thing,

head—she must study. She’ll stick upstairs and not
say a word for weeks; and the next thing is—she’s no

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs Buchner.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Oh, but Gussie too!—</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs Scholz.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Why don’t you ever play now?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs Scholz.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Oh that would be a fine thing. The little peace I have
would be done for. Augusta is so nervous—just like
her father—he’d run away from the piano as if he
were hunted.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs Buchner.</span></p>

<p class="speech">You should hear your William play now; he has improved!—What
would Ida be without him! She’s
learnt all she knows from him.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs Scholz.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Ah yes! so you told me. Oh, he’s full of talent, there’s
no doubt of that! It was a pleasure to teach
him.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs Buchner.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Yes! and he looks back with such affection on the time
when his little mother gave him his first lessons.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs Scholz.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Does he?—Good Lord, yes! those were pleasant times.
Then I used to think—every thing turns out differently—Oh!
I’m so agitated!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs Buchner.</span></p>

<p class="speech">So agitated?—What about?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs Scholz.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Why—about his coming—how does he look now—really?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs Buchner.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Well—strong—healthy. You’ll be proud of your son.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs Scholz.</span></p>

<p class="speech">I’m really surprised that the boy’s coming. It’s gone
to my heart many a time. And the notepaper he’s
cost me—and never once answered his old mother:
how have you brought him to it? That’s what I
can’t understand—that I <i>can’t</i> understand.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs Buchner.</span></p>

<p class="speech">I?—Oh! no! it was Ida who persuaded him.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs Scholz.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Robert doesn’t trouble himself much about us either, but at
least he comes once a year at Christmas time for a few
days: that’s not much to be grateful for—but William—six
whole years he’s not been here—neither he nor
my husband—for six whole years. Does she get on
with him?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs Buchner.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Ida?—Very well in every way.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs Scholz.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Well, that’s extraordinary. You simply can’t imagine
<i>how</i> reserved the boy always was—just like his father.
No playfellows, no school friends,—nothing.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs Buchner.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Yes, yes, that’s how he was with us at first. He never
would come near the house, except for the music-lesson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs Scholz.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Later, though, he came?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs Buchner.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Well,—yes. He said we mustn’t worry him, and when he
felt able he’d come of his own accord. We had the
sense to let him have his own way, and sure enough,
after waiting for him half a year, in fact,—when we’d
given up waiting, he came—and afterwards, day
after day, little by little, he became quite different.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs Scholz.</span></p>

<p class="speech">You must have bewitched him—his engagement alone—that’s
what I can’t get over.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs Buchner.</span></p>

<p class="speech">You must know how to manage with artists. I’ve learnt
that—my dear husband was one.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs Scholz.</span></p>

<p class="speech">And that—business—with his father? Has he confided
that to you, too?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs Buchner.</span></p>

<p class="speech">N-n-o, dear friend. You see that’s the one, only, point—the
one thing he can’t yet bring himself to—but you
may believe me, the remembrance is terribly painful
to him—is still—to this very day. And certainly not
less so because he <i>has</i> kept it to himself. At all
costs he must get over that, even in this matter too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs Scholz.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Oh, God forbid!—no, no—right is right! “Honour thy
father and thy mother.” A hand that you raise
against your own father—that’s an inhuman hand!
We’ve had our quarrels—oh yes! we’ve both our
faults, my husband and I, but that’s <i>our</i> business, no
human being has a right to interfere, least of all
one’s own son. And who had to suffer for it? I,
of course. An old woman like me has broad
shoulders; my husband left the house the very same
day, and half an hour later, William too. There
was no good talking; first I thought they would
come back, but whoever else did they didn’t! And
William alone is to blame for it, no one else—no one.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs Buchner.</span></p>

<p class="speech">William may have been <i>much</i> to blame—I’m convinced
of that. But think, to have repented for years,
and—</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs Scholz.</span></p>

<p class="speech">No—no! Good heavens, what can you be thinking of!
It’s not so easily got over; that would be worse
still. It’s very good of you to have taken so to the
boy, and it’s nice too that he’s coming—as indeed
why shouldn’t he? But, after all, what’s the good
of it? It’s not so easy to fill up a gulf—yes, yes,
there <i>are</i> gulfs—that’s what they are, gulfs—deep
gulfs—in our family.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs Buchner.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Still I can’t help thinking that we—that those of us with
firm, honest intentions—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs Scholz.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Intentions, intentions! don’t talk to me! I know better!
One can intend, and intend, and intend, hundreds of
things, and nothing gets any further. No, no!—it’s
quite another thing with your daughter. She is so—and
William is so—and both are what they are.—Much
too good a sort for one of us—much, much
too good.—Oh, Lord, yes!—intentions!—Ah yes!
all these good intentions—Your intentions are all
very well, but whether they lead to anything—I
doubt it!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs Buchner.</span></p>

<p class="speech">But I hope it—all the more.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs Scholz.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Well, it may be. I’ll say nothing to spoil it. In spite of
everything, my heart goes out to the boy; only it
excites me so, I’m frightened; and, mind you, it
won’t be all as easy as you think.</p>

beard, partially covering his cheeks; his movements
are clumsy and tremulous; he speaks brokenly, as
if with his mouth full; stumbles over syllables,
and is interrupted by gasping inspirations. He
is slovenly dressed: a velvet vest, coat and trousers

large peak, stone-grey in colour, peculiar in shape;
red silk neckerchief, linen creased. He uses a

each other for our common unhappiness, we have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>

and William this same hatred grew. That I understand
well enough. That I haven’t done what William

him—<i>nota bene</i>, so long as I don’t see him. But if
I see him, then all my logic goes to the devil, for I

<p class="speech">Here! A crime—all the more terrible because it did not
count as one. Here my life was given to me, and
here that same life—I can tell <i>you</i>, was—I had almost
said systematically destroyed, till it grew loathsome
to me—till I dragged it—bowed down like a beast
of burden—crept about with it—buried myself, hid
myself.—What can I say—one suffers beyond words!—Fury—hate—revenge—despair

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Ida.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Never! don’t think so badly of us! We have concealed
nothing from you! All of us, your mother, your
sister, we had not an idea, any more than you had;
he only came a few minutes ago,—without letting
anyone know beforehand, and so, you see—I thought
immediately—</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">William.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Who has told you that?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs Buchner</span> (<i>in tears, seizing his hands</i>).</p>

<p class="speech">You know that I—?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs Buchner</span> (<i>nods affirmatively</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Ida.</span></p>

<p class="speech">No, William, but whether I know it or not, that really
does not matter.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">William.</span></p>

<p class="speech">No?—This hand, that you, that you have often,—this
hand (<i>to Mrs Buchner</i>), it <i>was</i> that?</p>

you—another time!</p>

<p class="speech">William, I know what I am asking, but I—you <i>must</i>
humble yourself before your poor father; till then
you will never feel quite free! Call to him, pray
to him. Ah! William! you <i>must</i>! You must cling
to his knees, and if he spurns you with his foot, you
must not defend yourself! You must not speak a
word! patient as a lamb! Believe me, a woman
who wishes the <i>best</i> for you!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">William.</span></p>

<p class="speech">You <i>don’t</i> know, you cannot know, what you are asking

he has hidden the extent of your cruelty from you!
Infamous it may have been what I did! Sacrilegious!—But
what I have gone through, here—fought
through, suffered—those fearful tortures—he laid the
full burden, all the burden on me, and at the end<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
of all, that accursed sin! But in spite of all (<i>after a

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Ida.</span></p>

<p class="speech">No—what?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">William.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Did you see how he met me? He—you see—he <i>knows</i>
that I have to fly from myself, he knows me. Just
ask him, he will make it clear to you, that is to say,
he threatens to—Ah, I know better! Only just watch
how he always looks at me. He means me to be
anxious, to be frightened—Ha! ha! ha! No, my
dear brother, we’re not so pitiful as all that yet!
And now you <i>do</i> see, don’t you, Ida, that I daren’t
let you—I mean, you mustn’t have any illusions
about me. There is only one way. I must be frank
with you—I must manage <i>that</i> somehow—I fight for
that. When you know me through and through,
then—I mean if you can bear with me, if you
can still—love me—then—that would be—then I
think something might arise in me, something brave,
even proud—then I should <i>really</i> live, and if they
were all to despise me—(<i>Ida nestles against him devotedly.</i>)

this—between me and my father—yes, Ida, I <i>will</i>
do it—(<i>They walk arm in arm.</i>) Just imagine!
I was here on a visit.—No, I can’t begin like that,
I must go farther back. You know before that I
had been making my own way for a long time. I
suppose I hadn’t told you that?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Ida.</span></p>

<p class="speech">No—But quietly, only not so much—Don’t excite yourself
so, Willy!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">William.</span></p>

<p class="speech">You see—there again! I am a coward. I’ve never yet
dared to tell you what my life has been. In any
case it’s a risk—it’s a risk—even to one’s self. Ah!
well, if I can’t even bring myself to that point, how
shall I ever manage to go up to father?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Ida.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Ah, don’t—don’t torture yourself so! just now, when you
have so much to bear!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">William.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Ah! you are afraid? You’re afraid of what you may
hear?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Ida.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Sh! you must not speak like that.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">William.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Well then, just picture it. Father spent his life up there.
He had always lived alone till he met mother, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
he soon fell back into the old lonely, fantastic way
of life. All of a sudden he descended on us—Robert
and me,—he never troubled his head about Augusta....
Ten solid hours a day we pored over books;
when I look at our prison—even to-day—it was next
his study—you must have seen it?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Ida.</span></p>

<p class="speech">The great room upstairs?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">William.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Yes, that one. Once we had entered that room, the sun
might shine as brightly as it liked through the
windows, it was night for us inside. Well, then,
you see, we used to take refuge with mother;
we simply ran away from him; and then there used
to be scenes—mother pulling me by one arm, father
by the other. It came to this, that Friebe had to
carry us upstairs. We defended ourselves: we used
to bite his hands. Of course, nothing was any use;
our life only became more unendurable—but we
remained obstinate and—I know now—father began
to hate us. We drove him to such a point that one
day he hunted us downstairs; he couldn’t endure us
any more, the very sight of us was hateful to him.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Ida.</span></p>

<p class="speech">But your father—you’ll admit he meant well—he wanted
you to learn a great deal, and so—</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">William.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Up to a certain point he may have meant well—may have—but
at that time we were only boys of nine or ten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
and afterwards the good intentions disappeared. On
the contrary, his intention then was to let us go
utterly to ruin. Yes, yes, mother was a cipher.
For five years we were left to ourselves in the
most reckless way: we were scamps and loafers.
I had one thing left—my music; Robert had nothing.
But we took to other things besides. We shall
scarcely ever get over the effects of some of <i>them</i>.—At
last I suppose father’s conscience pricked him;
there were frightful scenes with mother. In the end
we were packed off to an Institution, and when I
could not stand the slavery of that any more and
ran away, he had me stopped and sent to Hamburg.
The good-for-nothing should go to America. The
good-for-nothing naturally ran away again. I let
my parents alone and starved and fought my own
way through the world. Robert has much the same
experience to look back upon. Nevertheless, in
father’s eyes we have remained good-for-nothings:
later on I was simple enough to ask him for some
help—as a right, not as charity; I wanted to go to
the Conservatoire. Then he wrote to me, on a
postcard, “Be a cobbler.” And so you see, Ida,
we are in a way self-made men, but we’re not
particularly proud of it.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Ida</span> (<i>smiling</i>).</p>

<p class="speech">Really, Willy, I can’t help it! I do sympathise with you
so, but at this moment I can’t help—Oh, don’t look
so strangely at me, please—please—</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">William.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Ah, Ida, it’s bitter, not a thing to laugh at.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Ida</span> (<i>breaking out</i>).</p>

<p class="speech">It’s a feeling of <i>joy</i>, William! I must tell you! It may
be selfish, but I am so inexpressibly glad that you—that
you can be so much in need of—Ah, I will be so
good to you, Willy. I see clearly what I have to do.
Ah! I am quite confused! I pity you so, but the
more I pity you, the more glad I am. Do you
understand? I mean, I am thinking how I may
perhaps—everything—all the love that you have had
to go without—I may perhaps more than—</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">William.</span></p>

<p class="speech">If I’m only worth it—for now something is coming for
which I alone am to blame—Years ago—no! it’s—I
used to come afterwards on a sort of visit to mother.
Picture to yourself, Ida, when I saw all that misery
again, just imagine how I used to feel.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Ida.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Your mother—suffered very much?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">William.</span></p>

<p class="speech">I think differently now in many ways about mother. In
any case, father was most to blame. In those days it
used to seem to me as if he kept mother here against
her will. I even wanted her to separate from him.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Ida.</span></p>

<p class="speech">But, your mother surely couldn’t—</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">William.</span></p>

<p class="speech">She didn’t see it as I did. She hadn’t the courage.
Well, what father used to look like in my eyes, you
can perhaps imagine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Ida.</span></p>

<p class="speech">But William! Perhaps you too, were not quite just to
your father—a man—</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">William</span> (<i>without noticing Ida’s interruption.</i>)</p>

<p class="speech">Once I committed the folly of bringing a friend—nonsense!
not a friend, a chance acquaintance, a musical fellow.
I brought him here with me. That was quite refreshing
for mother; she played duets with him
every day for a whole week, and then—frightful!—as
true as I’m here he—not the shadow of a
possibility! Yet at the end of the week even the
servants flung it in her face!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Ida.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Forgive me! I don’t—I—flung what?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">William.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Mother—mother was supposed to—my mother—supposed
to—just think, they actually dared to accuse her of
it openly, she—a secret understanding with—that she—I
taxed her with it—the girl who said it—insolent—the
coachman had told her. I went to the coachman,
and he—he stuck to it—had it from the master,
from the master himself—, naturally I—was it possible
I could believe such a thing! At least I tried not to—until
I myself overheard—in the stables—father
and the stable boy—you may believe my very hands
tingled when I heard him—about my mother.</p>

suddenly in father’s room. I saw him. He was

<p class="direction">[<i>During the Doctor’s approach William shows more
and more excitement. His colour changes quickly,
he thrusts his hands through his hair, breathes
deeply, makes movements with his right hand as
though playing the piano. It is quite evident
that he is torn by different emotions, that his
resolution is shaken. He seems about to rush
away, but is stopped by the Doctor’s entrance.
He has caught hold of the back of a chair to
support himself and stands there white and
trembling. The Doctor, drawn up to his full
imposing height, measures his son with a look
in which terror, hate and contempt are expressed.
There is a silence. Friebe, who has entered with
the Doctor, whom he has led and lighted down the
stairs, makes use of the pause to slink away into
the kitchen. William shows marked signs of his
mental conflict. He tries to speak, his voice fails
him, only his lips move noiselessly. He takes his
hand from the chair back and steps up to the old
man. He stumbles, staggers, and almost falls;
stops and tries to speak again, and cannot; drags
himself nearer, and clasping his hands, sinks at
the old man’s feet. In Doctor Scholz’s face the
expression has changed from hate to astonishment,
growing sympathy and confusion.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p class="speech">He can be, and till now I never knew it.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">William.</span></p>

<p class="speech">A good deal is beginning to dawn on me.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Robert.</span></p>

<p class="speech">With my brain and so on, you know, I have grasped it
long enough. Everything that happened had to be;
I never held father responsible—at least, I haven’t
for years. Certainly not for me—not for any of
us. But to-day I have really <i>felt</i> it; and that, you
know, is quite another thing—Frankly, it’s taken
me right off my balance. When I saw him so—so
anxious over you, it was like a blow to me; and now
I shall always be thinking:—That was there, living,
in us.—Why on earth didn’t it show itself before?
In father—in you—and, by God! in me too. It was
there in us! And there he has been stifling it in himself—father,
I mean—yes, and we too, for years and
years—</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">William.</span></p>

<p class="speech">I see one thing: we not only show a different self to every
one of our fellow-creatures, but we <i>are</i> fundamentally
different to each.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Robert.</span></p>

<p class="speech">But why must it be so with us? Why must we for ever
keep each other at such a distance?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">William.</span></p>

<p class="speech">I’ll tell you why; because we have no natural goodness
of heart. Take Ida for instance: what you have got
at by hard thinking is natural to her. She never sits
in judgment, she treats everything so gently, with
such sympathy, and that spares people so much—you
understand—and I believe it is that—</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Robert</span> (<i>abruptly, rises</i>).</p>

<p class="speech">How do you feel now?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">William.</span></p>

<p class="speech">I feel relieved—free.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Robert.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Ah! what’s the use of all that—H’m! what was I going
to say—Perhaps it will turn out all right for you.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">William.</span></p>

<p class="speech">What do you mean?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Robert.</span></p>

<p class="speech">What should I mean? For you and—for Ida, of course.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">William.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Perhaps! Those two have such a power—Mrs Buchner
too—but particularly Ida. I have thought that might
save me—At first I checked myself—</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Robert</span> (<i>thoughtfully</i>).</p>

<p class="speech">Yes they have! they have a power, and just because of

The confidence I had in myself!—I, to fancy I could
influence such natures!—a weak, simple creature like
me! But now I’m uneasy about it all—now all at
once I feel my heavy responsibility. I am responsible
for my child—for my Ida. Every mother is responsible
for her child! Only tell me, William, tell me yourself,
that it will all come right—Say to me, “we shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>

you. What did I say to you? I said, all of us, every

<p class="speech">What’s one to do?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">William.</span></p>

Conscious as I am, knowing what I now know!—I

the gnawing of conscience! Ah! well, what’s the

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Robert.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Eh! as to that! one would have enough to do. The old

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">William.</span></p>

<p class="speech">I tell you, it is sacred earnest to me—I would lay down
this pitiful life of mine gladly, if it would do him any
good.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Robert.</span></p>

<p class="speech">To my thinking, there’s no sense in that. Now just look
here! I go back to my hot little den of an office, sit
with my back to the fire, cross my legs under the table,
light this same old pipe, and write—in peace and
quietness of mind, I hope—the same old jokes, you
know them,—the old chestnuts—African traveller—nearly
spent—h’m, and then I generally bring along
a caravan, which takes the article along with it.—My
chief is well satisfied, it gets copied in as many
papers as possible—and, the main thing is that—!
Well, I sit there, and the gas jet hisses over my
head all day—a glance now and then into the
court—the courtyard of a warehouse like that has
something marvellous about it—something even
romantic, I can tell you—in a word I’m not troubled
with any bees in <i>my</i> bonnet.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">William.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Rather be dead once for all.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Robert.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Matter of taste!—For me, that’s just an ideal nook—Is
one to be always getting shaken off one’s balance,
always letting oneself be driven crazy?—It’ll take
me a good two or three days now to pick up
my scattered philosophy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">William.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Say what you will, I call that cowardly.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Robert.</span></p>

<p class="speech">And then—If it is! Sooner or later, you will come to
think as I do. Father himself had at last got to
that standpoint. Father and you, you are as alike
as two peas. You are both idealists of the same
sort. In ’38 father started on the barricades, and he
finishes up as a hypochondriacal hermit—One must
get accustomed to the world and to oneself <i>in time</i>,
that’s the thing; before one has finished sowing one’s
wild oats.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">William.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Or else work at oneself, to become something different.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Robert.</span></p>

<p class="speech">I think I see myself! What I am, I am. I have the
right to <i>be</i>, whatever I am.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">William.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Then claim your right openly.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Robert.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Not I, for I mean to <i>have</i> it. The Philistine morality-mongers
are in the majority at present. Anyhow
it’s time for me to be off. And if I were to offer
you a bit of advice, it would be, beware of so-called
good intentions!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">William</span> (<i>coldly</i>).</p>

<p class="speech">How do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Robert.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Simply that; it’s no use to think of accomplishing something
which entirely contradicts one’s whole natural
bent.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">William.</span></p>

<p class="speech">As, for instance?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Robert.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Oh!—for instance, fellows come to me sometimes, who
babble ideals to me till my head swims. Fight for
the ideals of humanity, and—God knows what all!
I—fight for other people!—Childish!—Why, and what
for? But <i>you</i>, that just suits you. You would rush
round like a runaway thief. “What a wretch I have
been,” you would keep on telling yourself! Aren’t I
right? Well, and then on the top would come the
good intentions, and they get hold of you, I know.
<i>I</i> used to go about hung round with hundreds of
those good intentions—for years together—and it’s
not pleasant, I can tell you.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">William.</span></p>

<p class="speech">I don’t really know what you are driving at.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Robert.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Nothing very definite. This unrest, from which you are
suffering now, has no doubt other causes—At least
I—if I once noticed—there was a time when I went
through something of the sort, but once I noticed
that the business was likely to be stronger than I—I
generally made short work of it, and turned my
back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">William.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Is that a hint?</p>

<p class="speech">Hint? I didn’t know—well, once more—good luck to
you and—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<p class="speech">Yes.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">William.</span></p>

<p class="speech">No.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">William.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Good—Thanks—You are candid—I thank you—But let
us suppose,—say that I <i>did</i> turn my back on the
whole affair—leave on one side all thought of what

<p class="speech">H’m, Ida—Ida?—(<i>Shrugs his shoulders.</i>) H’m, yes. That’s
not so quickly—at least—that wouldn’t trouble me
over much.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">William.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Ah! That’s your old selfishness!!! Now I recognise
you.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Robert.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Selfish? How? No, that’s just your mistake! I am

in this particular matter, I mean. I really don’t
believe—</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">William.</span></p>

Depend upon it—she has that sort of feeling for me,
which—well, I can’t alter it. You needn’t think me
conceited—But, you see, what’s to become of her,
if I should go?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Robert.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Oh yes, but one can:—mother!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Robert.</span></p>

you are indifferent as to what becomes of the girl,
if you have the desirable dose of—well call it recklessness—if
you take her, as you would a new coat
or hat or something—</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">William.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Robert!—Heartless through and through as you are—you’re
right this time. I’m with you, out of this
place—That is, I’ll go with you a little way, not
far, and now, now I’ve done with all of you—Yes,
yes, now I’m—don’t speak!—now I’ve really done—absolutely—(<i>Robert
looks at him astonished, and
shrugs his shoulders. With increasing vehemence</i>)
Don’t, don’t trouble yourself—it’s no good! You can’t
do it—you can’t take me in with your harmless quiet.
You’re in the right, but what has put you in the
right, what has made you so clear-sighted? Shall I
tell you? Jealousy—miserable <i>jealousy</i>—nothing
else—simply pitiful malice!—You know very well
that I should fight honestly—try to be a little worthier
of her. You know very well that with her purity,
this girl has power to purify me!—But you don’t
want that! You don’t want to see me cleansed!—Why
not?—Because you—you yourself must always
be what you have been—because it is <i>me</i> she loves,
and never you! And so the whole evening you have
shadowed me with your detective looks—for ever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
there to remind me you know me for what I am!
Yes! You are right!—I am sin-stained through and
through!—Nothing left of me is pure. Tainted, I
have nothing in common with her innocence—and I
am determined not to commit this crime. But you,
Robert!—That makes you none the purer; give
thanks that you no longer can feel shame!</p>

<p><a href="#Page_iii">Title-page.</a> <i>The Coming of Peace.</i> This is a somewhat free
translation of the title of Hauptmann’s play. Friedensfest
means literally the Feast or Festival of Peace, but the English
title we have chosen seemed more euphonious and has besides
a bearing on the end of the play, when the old man at any-rate
enters into his rest.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_6">P. 6.</a> <i>O Gottogottogott!</i> The effect of this exclamation,
which Mrs Scholz uses all through the play, cannot be reproduced
in English. We have tried, in the translation, by
joining the words with a hyphen, to give as far as might
be the look of one word. Oh Godohgodohgod! would only
have puzzled readers. Even in speaking, the change from the
<i>t</i> to <i>d</i> makes the attempt to pronounce the exclamation as
one word almost impossible. Moreover to English eyes and
ears “Oh God” of course carries a weight quite incongruous
in Mrs Scholz’s chatter. Here, as in many other places, we
were unable to arrive at an entirely satisfactory equivalent
for the German.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_16">P. 16.</a> <i>That’s an inhuman hand!</i> This cannot be called a
<i>translation</i>. Mrs Scholz says: “Aus dem Grabe wachsen
solche Hände!” She here alludes to an old German saying
still quoted among the peasantry, which declares that the
hand of anyone guilty of striking a parent would, after death,
point upward from the grave in ceaseless self-accusation. We
have been unable to find any similar superstition in English
folk-lore.</p>
